# These are the templates for the model.
# Tips:
# - Always include a beginning of sentence tag <s> (it isn't added for you!)
# - The parser will replace variables and compute embeddings on things inside of braces, 
#   so be sure to reference variables inside of braces only (e.g. {!%%prompt%%,} will be 
#   replaced with the prompt, and {%%text%%} will be replaced with the text)
# - The pooling will take the {mean, last} of the token embeddings that are inside braces
#   except when the braces start with {! which means the text won't be included}. See usage
#   in the example below.
# - Example: "<s>The last-token of {this text %%text%% will be </s>} even though there
#             is {!text after it.</s>}"
# - When using max_tokens, the parser will enforce that every separate {} has at most 
#   max_tokens; this means that if you have multiple braces, the max_tokens will be
#   enforced for each set of braces separately. This is why {</s>} is enclosed in 
#   separate braces: so that </s> will not be cut off if %%text%% exceeds the max_tokens.
